# RLS (Row Level Security) Fix for Profile Updates

## Problem Solved
The application was experiencing "row level security" errors when trying to update user profiles. This happened because:

1. **API routes used admin Supabase client without user context**
   - `auth.uid()` returned `null` in RLS policies
   - Profile updates were blocked by security policies

2. **Missing authentication in API requests**
   - Client-side requests didn't include user access tokens
   - API routes couldn't verify the authenticated user

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated API Routes to Use Authenticated Supabase Client

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/profile/[id]/route.js` - Main profile update endpoint
- `src/app/api/profile/upload/route.js` - Profile image upload endpoint

**Changes:**
- Added `createAuthenticatedClient()` helper function
- API routes now create Supabase client with user's access token
- Added proper authentication verification
- Separated read operations (admin client) from write operations (authenticated client)

### 2. Updated Client-Side Code to Send Authorization Headers

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/profile/edit/page.js` - Profile editing page
- `src/app/components/profile/AboutSection.js` - About section component

**Changes:**
- Added Authorization header with user's access token to API requests
- Used `getCurrentSession()` to get access token before API calls

### 3. How It Works Now

1. **Client Side:**
   ```javascript
   const session = await getCurrentSession();
   const response = await fetch(`/api/profile/${user.id}`, {
     method: "PUT",
     headers: {
       "Content-Type": "application/json",
       "Authorization": `Bearer ${session?.access_token}`,
     },
     body: JSON.stringify(profile),
   });
   ```

2. **API Side:**
   ```javascript
   // Create authenticated client
   const supabase = createAuthenticatedClient(request);
   
   // Verify user authentication
   const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
   
   // RLS now works because auth.uid() = user.id
   const { data, error } = await supabase
     .from("profiles")
     .update(updates)
     .eq("id", user.id);
   ```

### 4. Security Benefits

✅ **Proper Authentication**: API routes verify user identity
✅ **RLS Compliance**: `auth.uid()` matches the user making the request  
✅ **Authorization**: Users can only update their own profiles
✅ **Data Integrity**: Profile updates are properly secured

## RLS Policy Requirements

Your Supabase RLS policy should look like:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" 
ON public.profiles 
FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

This policy now works correctly because:
- `auth.uid()` returns the authenticated user's ID (from the access token)
- `id` is the profile ID being updated
- Users can only update profiles where these IDs match

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Log in to your application
2. Go to profile editing page
3. Try updating profile information
4. Check that updates succeed without RLS errors
5. Verify that users cannot update other users' profiles

The fix maintains security while enabling proper profile updates for authenticated users.
